# Active Collab (Feather) CLI
This is something I wanted to make because at our company we deal with a lot of projects. The tool only lists tasks that are assigned to the current signed in user.

You can select tasks and add time to them. That's it.

## Install

    npm i -g nckg/ac-cli

Credentials are stored in `.env`.

## Use

    acli

## TODO
- ~Log time~
- Complete task
- Move task to other tasklist
- Tests
